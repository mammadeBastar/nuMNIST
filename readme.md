#nuMNIST

wrote this neural network using numpy to challenge my fundamental neural net knowlege, and taught it'd be cool to build an application interface for it using streamlit python library and got carried away into pre-processing the image before handing it to the network.<br/>
and also it dosen't work quite perfectly i need to optimize the network a bit to stop it from overfitting and train it again.<br/>
###here are some pictures of the ui:<br/>
